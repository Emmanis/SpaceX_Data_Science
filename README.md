# SpaceX Data Science and Machine Learning Labs

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts that demonstrate data collection, wrangling, visualization, 
and machine learning using SpaceX launch data. The project walks through the full data science workflow, from gathering data 
to building interactive dashboards and predictive models.
